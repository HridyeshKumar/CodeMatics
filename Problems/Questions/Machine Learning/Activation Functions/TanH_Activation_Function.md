# Tanh Activation Function

The hyperbolic tangent function, commonly known as tanh, is an activation function used in neural networks and other machine learning models. It maps real-valued numbers to a range between -1 and 1, making it suitable for scenarios where you want to center your data around zero. Here’s an introduction to the tanh function:

## What is the Tanh Function?
The tanh function is a mathematical function that describes the hyperbolic tangent of a given input. It is defined as:

$$
\text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$
where:

- 𝑥 is the input to the function.
- 𝑒 is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).
