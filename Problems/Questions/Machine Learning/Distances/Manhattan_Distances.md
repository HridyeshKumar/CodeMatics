# Manhattan Distance
Manhattan distance, also known as L1 distance or taxicab distance, is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. It measures the distance between two points along the axes at right angles (like a grid).

## Definition
For two points 
$A=(a_1,a_2,…,a_n)$ and 
$B=(b_1,b2,…,b_n)$ in an 
$n$-dimensional space, the Manhattan distance is calculated as:

$$
\text{Manhattan\_distance}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - b_i|
$$

**Example:**

In a 2-dimensional space, if \( ${A} = (1, 2)$ \) and \( ${B} = (4, 6)$ \):

$$
\text{Manhattan\_distance}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = |1 - 4| + |2 - 6| = 3 + 4 = 7
$$

## Challenge

Create a Manhattan Distance Function to calculate $n$-dimensional vectors.
