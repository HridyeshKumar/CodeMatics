## System of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. Solving the system involves finding the values of the variables that satisfy all the equations simultaneously.

### Definition

A system of linear equations can be represented in matrix form as:

$$
A \cdot \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
$$

where:
- \( A \) is the coefficient matrix
- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the vector of variables
- \( \mathbf{b} \) is the constant vector

### Example

Consider the following system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
2x + 3y = 13 \\
4x - y = 5
\end{cases}
$$

This system can be represented in matrix form as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
13 \\
5
\end{pmatrix}

$$

### Solving the System

To solve the system, we can use various methods such as:

1. **Substitution Method**: Solve one of the equations for one variable and substitute this value into the other equations.
2. **Elimination Method**: Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable, then solve the resulting simpler system.
3. **Matrix Method**: Use matrix operations to find the solution. This involves:
   - Finding the inverse of matrix \( A \) (if it exists)
   - Multiplying the inverse of \( A \) by \( \mathbf{b} \)

### Example Solution using Matrix Method

For the example system:

1. Find the inverse of matrix \( A \):

$$
A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
4 & -1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
$$

2. Multiply the inverse by \( \mathbf{b} \):

$$
\mathbf{x} = A^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{b}
$$

### Applications

Solving systems of linear equations is crucial in various fields including:
- Engineering for circuit analysis
- Economics for market equilibrium analysis
- Computer science for algorithm development

## Problem Statement
