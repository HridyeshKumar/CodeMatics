## Trace of a Matrix

The trace of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix. The trace provides important properties and insights into the matrix.

### Definition

For a square matrix \( A \) of size (n x n), the trace is denoted by \( tr(A) \) and is calculated as:

$$
\text{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ii}
$$

where:
- \( $ a_{ii} $  \) are the diagonal elements of the matrix \( A \)

### Example

Consider the matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The trace of matrix \( A \) is calculated as:

$$
\text{tr}(A) = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11
$$

### Properties

- **Linearity**: The trace operation is linear, meaning for matrices \( A \) and \( B \) and scalars \( $ \alpha $ \) and \( $ \beta $ \):

  $$
  \text{tr}(\alpha A + \beta B) = \alpha \text{tr}(A) + \beta \text{tr}(B)
  $$

- **Similarity Invariance**: The trace of a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations. If \( $ B = P^{-1}AP $ \), then:

  $$
  \text{tr}(B) = \text{tr}(A)
  $$

- **Trace of Product**: For matrices \( A \) and \( B \) of compatible dimensions:

  $$
  \text{tr}(AB) = \text{tr}(BA)
  $$

### Applications

The trace of a matrix has applications in various fields including:
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Trace is used in calculating expectation values.
- **Statistics**: Trace helps in understanding variance-covariance matrices.
- **Graph Theory**: Trace is used in spectral graph theory to analyze properties of graphs.

## Problem Statement

Given a square matrix \( A \), your task is to compute the trace of the matrix by summing its diagonal elements.
