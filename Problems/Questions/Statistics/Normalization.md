## Normalization in Statistics

Normalization is a technique used in statistics and data preprocessing to scale the values of a dataset so that they fall within a specified range, typically [0, 1]. This process ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis and is especially useful when the data features have different ranges or units.

### Definition

For a given dataset with a feature \( x \), the normalized value \( x' \) is computed as:

$$
x' = \frac{x - x_{\min}}{x_{\max} - x_{\min}}
$$

where:
- \( x \) is the original value
- \( $ x_{\min} $ \) is the minimum value in the dataset
- \( $ x_{\max} $ \) is the maximum value in the dataset

### Example

Consider a dataset:

$$
X = \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50\}
$$

To normalize this dataset:
1. Identify the minimum and maximum values:

$$
x_{\min} = 10, \quad x_{\max} = 50
$$

2. Normalize each value \( x \) using the formula \( $ x' = \frac{x - x_{\min}}{x_{\max} - x_{\min}} $ \).

For example, for \( x = 20 \):

$$
x' = \frac{20 - 10}{50 - 10} = \frac{10}{40} = 0.25
$$

After normalization, the dataset \( X' \) becomes:

$$
X' = \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}
$$

### Importance

Normalization is crucial in scenarios where features in a dataset have different scales or units. It helps improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by ensuring that all features are treated equally during the analysis.

### Applications

Normalization is commonly used in:
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms like Neural Networks and Gradient Descent converge faster with normalized data.
- **Data Visualization**: Helps in presenting data on a comparable scale.
- **Clustering and Classification**: Ensures that distance-based algorithms like K-Means and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) work effectively.

### Difference from Standardization

While both normalization and standardization are used for data scaling, they have different purposes:
- **Normalization**: Scales data to a specific range, typically [0, 1].
- **Standardization**: Centers data around the mean and scales it based on standard deviation (producing Z-scores).

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset, your task is to normalize the data by scaling each feature to the range [0, 1]. This involves subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) for each feature.
