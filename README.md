## Submitting in the repository
This repository is a collaborative space for our club members to practice and learn from each other. Here's how you can contribute:
1. Answer a Question: If you see a question you can answer, create a new file with the following naming convention: {Team_name_problem_no}.{file_extention}
(e.g., (JohnDoe_3.rs)). Include your name, semester, and a clear explanation of your solution.
2. Submit Your Answer: Commit your answer file and submit a pull request. Our moderators will review your submission and provide feedback.
3. Official Answer: After reviewing all submissions, we will post an official answer for each question. This will help us learn from each other and improve our understanding of the subject matter.

Guidelines

- Be respectful and helpful in your interactions with other members.
- Follow the naming convention for answer files.
- Include clear explanations and comments in your code.
- Test your code before submitting.

By contributing to this repository, you'll improve your skills and help your fellow members learn and grow. Let's work together to create a supportive and knowledge-sharingÂ community!


TLDR; This event focuses on developing insights about different Mathematical, Statistical and Machine Learning formulae and their implementation.
